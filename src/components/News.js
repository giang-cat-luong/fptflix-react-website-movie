                                Fans shocked after CP0 returns in One Piece 1062

                                After many years of waiting, One Piece has finally introduced fans to the enigmatic figure of Dr. Vegapunk. However, things are not what they seem. It was disclosed that the female-looking person who claimed to be Vegapunk is a cyborg and that there are six similar bodies in total, one of whom may or may not be the scientist's true appearance.
                                But the shocking news was not over. One Piece 1062 revealed that CP0, the greatest of all the secret agencies in the World Government's direct employment, is approaching Egghead Island with an outrageous mission - killing Vegapunk. Follow this thread to learn everything about CP0 and its goals.<br />
                                There have been several villages in Italy eager to sell €1 and cheap homes that have had to give up on their plans once hidden issues came to light.<br />

                                Back in 2014, the towns of Carrega Ligure, in Piedmont, and Lecce nei Marsi, in Abruzzo, tried hard to sell their old properties off at a bargain price but just couldn’t get past Italy’s labyrinthine red tape, hellish property restrictions, and scores of bickering relatives.

                                Both towns’ mayors found themselves chasing after the many heirs of unknown property owners who had emigrated in the 1800s. All existing relatives, who technically owned small parcels of the same house (whether they knew it or not), had to all agree on the sale.<br />

                                Under Italian law, over time and generations a property ‘pulverizes’ into many little shares depending on how many heirs are involved (if one single heir is not named).

                                You can end up in a situation where you agree with two owners that you’ll buy their old house, and then one day another five knock at your door saying they never gave their consent, nullifying your purchase. So it’s always best to check beforehand the local land registry to see exactly who, and how many, are the owners, and where they are.

As rumors swirl that World War Hulk may soon bring Hulk back to the big screen, She-Hulk currently serves as the next best thing.<br />

                                During Norton's one and only Hulk outing, the gamma-infused Avenger went up against Tim Roth's Emil Blonsky, aka the Abomination. But in the many years between The Incredible Hulk and She-Hulk, which brought the Abomination back into the MCU, Blonsky appeared to have turned a corner and be on the road to redemption.<br />

                                As Jennifer Walters finds her footing as She-Hulk and a superhero lawyer, Bruce Banner has been absent in the depths of space, having last disappeared away aboard a Sakaarian ship. Following speculation as to the nature of his intergalactic trip, a new promo has revealed his She-Hulk return and a surprise rematch.
